# Tunisian Vocabulary Flash Cards / تونس
A little repository / tool to generate flashcards
for http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/ that combine language that goes right to left and language that goes left to right.  Using both in the same file tends to confuse the file editor.

Tips for Flashcards Deluxe:
 - in the deck set the "Side 2" font size to 'Giant'
 - if you're slow to read, like I am, add a couple seconds to the side two display timer


 ## Todo
 - Add a side 3 with the phonetic pronunciation
 - Smaller better named deck groupings
